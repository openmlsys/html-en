# Recommender System

Recommender systems serve as intelligent agents, offering suggestions
for items most relevant to a specific user. To do so, they scrutinize
data items such as user characteristics, item features, and the
interactions between the two. Over the past few years, powerhouse
companies like Google, Facebook, and Alibaba have harnessed deep
learning technologies to enhance the capabilities of recommender models.
By deploying deep learning methodologies, these systems are endowed with
the capability to effectively learn from data through gradient-based
methods. Moreover, these systems are able to exploit large neural
networks, including transformers and emerging large language models.
This, in turn, bolsters the system's proficiency in dissecting complex,
multi-modal data.

In this chapter, we will delve into the foundational elements of deep
learning recommender systems (DLRSs). We will elucidate key operational
processes within these systems, primarily focusing on the multi-stage
generation of recommendations and the updating of model parameters.
Lastly, we will delve into a real-world recommender system, shedding
light on strategic approaches used to tackle practical challenges.

This chapter has the following learning objectives:

1.  Understand the architecture of a recommender system and its
    essential components.

2.  Understand multi-stage recommendation and model update in a
    recommender system.

3.  Attain insights into the challenges faced by practical recommender
    systems and discover their corresponding solutions.
