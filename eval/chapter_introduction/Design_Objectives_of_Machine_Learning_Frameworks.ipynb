    "# Design Objectives of Machine Learning Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "*Machine learning frameworks* (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MindSpore)\n",
    "were designed and implemented so that machine learning algorithms could\n",
    "be developed efficiently for different applications. In a broad sense,\n",
    "these frameworks achieved the following common design objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Neural network programming:** The huge success of deep learning\n",
    "    has solidified neural networks as the core of many machine learning\n",
    "    applications. People need to customize neural networks to meet their\n",
    "    specific application requirements --- such customization typically\n",
    "    results in the creation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and\n",
    "    self-attention neural networks. In order to develop, train, and\n",
    "    deploy these networks, we need a generic system software.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Automatic differentiation:** The training of neural networks\n",
    "    involves continuously computing gradients through the combined use\n",
    "    of training data, data annotation, and a loss function to\n",
    "    iteratively improve model parameters. Computing gradients manually\n",
    "    is a complex and time-consuming task. Consequently, a machine\n",
    "    learning framework is expected to compute gradients automatically\n",
    "    based on a neural network application provided by developers. This\n",
    "    computation process is called automatic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Data management and processing:** Data is the key to machine\n",
    "    learning. There are several types of data, including training,\n",
    "    validation, and test datasets, as well as model parameters. A\n",
    "    machine learning system should be able to read, store, and\n",
    "    preprocess (data augmentation and cleansing are examples of\n",
    "    preprocessing) these types of data by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Model training and deployment:** A machine learning model is\n",
    "    expected to provide optimal performance. In order to achieve this,\n",
    "    we need to use an optimization method --- for example, mini-batch\n",
    "    stochastic gradient descent (SGD) --- to repeatedly compute\n",
    "    gradients through multi-step iteration. This process is called\n",
    "    training. Once the training is complete, we can then deploy the\n",
    "    trained model to the inference device.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Hardware accelerators:** Many core operations in machine learning\n",
    "    can be deemed as matrix computation. To accelerate such computation,\n",
    "    machine learning developers leverage many specially designed\n",
    "    hardware components referred to as hardware accelerators or AI\n",
    "    chips.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Distributed training:** As the volume of training data and the\n",
    "    number of neural network parameters increase, the amount of memory\n",
    "    used by a machine learning system far exceeds what a single machine\n",
    "    can provide. Therefore, a machine learning framework should be able\n",
    "    to train models on distributed machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early attempts by developers to design such a framework employed\n",
    "traditional methods such as *neural network libraries* (e.g., Theano and\n",
    "Caffe) and *data processing frameworks* (e.g., Apache Spark and Google's\n",
    "Pregel), but the results were disappointing. At that time, neural\n",
    "network libraries lacked the ability to manage and process large\n",
    "datasets, deploy models, or perform distributed model execution, meaning\n",
    "they were not qualified enough for developing today's product-level\n",
    "machine learning applications even though they supported neural network\n",
    "development, automatic differentiation, and hardware accelerators.\n",
    "Furthermore, data-parallel computing frameworks were not suitable for\n",
    "developing neural network--centered machine learning applications\n",
    "because they lacked support for neural networks, automatic\n",
    "differentiation, and accelerators, although such frameworks were already\n",
    "mature in supporting distributed running and data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "These drawbacks led many enterprise developers and university\n",
    "researchers to design and implement their own software frameworks for\n",
    "machine learning from scratch. In only a few short years, numerous\n",
    "machine learning frameworks emerged --- well-known examples of these\n",
    "include TensorFlow, PyTorch, MindSpore, MXNet, PaddlePaddle, OneFlow,\n",
    "and CNTK. These frameworks boosted the development of AI significantly\n",
    "in both upstream and downstream industries. Table\n",
    ":numref:`intro-comparison` lists the differences between machine\n",
    "learning frameworks and other related systems.\n",
