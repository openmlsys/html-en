    "# Application Scenarios of Machine Learning Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning framework is commonly utilized in diverse scenarios,\n",
    "giving rise to a range of *machine learning systems*. In a broader\n",
    "context, a machine learning system refers to a collective term\n",
    "encompassing a variety of software and hardware systems that facilitate\n",
    "and execute machine learning applications. Figure\n",
    ":numref:`intro/system-ecosystem` provides an overview of the\n",
    "various application scenarios for machine learning systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Application scenarios of machine learningsystems](../img/intro/system-ecosystem.png)\n",
    ":label:`intro/system-ecosystem`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Federated learning:** Laws and regulations on user privacy\n",
    "    protection and data protection prevent many machine learning\n",
    "    applications from accessing user data directly for model training\n",
    "    purposes. This is where federated learning --- based on a machine\n",
    "    learning framework --- benefits such applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Recommender system:** Incorporating machine learning (especially\n",
    "    deep learning) into recommender systems have achieved major success\n",
    "    over the past few years. Compared with traditional rule-based\n",
    "    recommender systems, those based on deep learning can analyze\n",
    "    massive feature data of users more effectively, thereby bringing\n",
    "    huge improvements to the accuracy and timeliness of recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Reinforcement learning:** Because reinforcement learning is\n",
    "    special in terms of the way it collects data and trains models, it\n",
    "    is therefore necessary to develop dedicated reinforcement learning\n",
    "    systems based on a machine learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Explainable AI:** As machine learning becomes more and more\n",
    "    popular in many key areas, including finance, healthcare, and\n",
    "    governmental affairs, developing explainable AI systems based on a\n",
    "    machine learning framework is gaining wider attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Robotics:** Robotics is another area where the use of machine\n",
    "    learning frameworks is gaining popularity. Compared with traditional\n",
    "    robot vision methods, machine learning methods have achieved\n",
    "    enormous success in several robot tasks, such as automatic feature\n",
    "    extraction, target recognition, and path planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Graph learning:** Graphs are the most widely used data structure\n",
    "    and are used to express large volumes of Internet data, for\n",
    "    instance, social network graphs and product relationship graphs.\n",
    "    Machine learning algorithms have been proven effective for analyzing\n",
    "    large-scale graph data. A machine learning system designed to\n",
    "    process graph data is referred to as a graph learning system.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Scientific computing:** Scientific computing covers a wide range\n",
    "    of traditional fields (such as electromagnetic simulation, graphics,\n",
    "    and weather forecast), in which many large-scale problems can be\n",
    "    effectively solved by machine learning methods. Therefore,\n",
    "    developing special machine learning systems for scientific computing\n",
    "    is becoming an increasingly common practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Scheduling of a machine learning cluster:** A machine learning\n",
    "    cluster consists of heterogeneous processors, heterogeneous\n",
    "    networks, and even heterogeneous storage devices. But in a machine\n",
    "    learning cluster, computing tasks often have common characteristics\n",
    "    during their execution (e.g., iterative execution based on the\n",
    "    collective communication operator AllReduce). In order to take\n",
    "    account of the cluster's heterogeneity of devices and the common\n",
    "    characteristics in task execution, a machine learning cluster is\n",
    "    often designed to use a special scheduling method.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **Quantum computing:** Quantum computers are generally realized\n",
    "    through a hybrid architecture, in which quantum computing is\n",
    "    performed by quantum computers and the simulation of quantum\n",
    "    computers is performed by classical computers. Many simulation\n",
    "    systems (such as TensorFlow Quantum and MindQuantum) are realized on\n",
    "    the basis of a machine learning framework because the simulation\n",
    "    often requires massive matrix computations and gradient computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are too many machine learning systems for this book to cover them\n",
    "all in depth. Instead, we aim to provide a system designer's perspective\n",
    "on several core systems used in federated learning, recommenders,\n",
    "reinforcement learning, explainable AI, and robotics.\n"
