    "flow operators, and control flow operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Tensor operators** involve tensor structure and mathematical\n",
    "    operations. Typical tensor structure operations include reshaping\n",
    "    tensors, permuting tensor dimensions, concatenating tensors, etc.\n",
    "    For example, we may need to change the dimension order (between\n",

    "    models, are the most common operators, including feature extraction,\n",
    "    activation functions, loss functions, optimization algorithms, etc.\n",
    "    Feature extraction refers to extracting feature tensors from input\n",

    "    relationships and patterns in data. Optimization algorithms are used\n",
    "    to update model parameters so that the loss function is minimized.\n",

    "3.  **Data flow operators** cover data preprocessing and loading. Data\n",
    "    preprocessing mainly refers to data resizing, padding,\n",
    "    normalization, and argumentation of mostly visual and textual data,\n",

    "4.  **Control flow operators**, usually found in flexible and complex\n",
    "    models, are used to control data flows in computational graphs.\n",
    "    Typical control flow operators are conditional operators and loop\n",

    "\n",
    "In a computational graph, the dependencies between operators influence\n",
    "the execution sequence and parallelism of operators. The computational\n",
    "graphs involved in machine learning algorithms are directed acyclic\n",
    "graphs, where data flows must not lead to circular dependencies. With a\n",
    "circular dependency, the training program will run into an infinite loop\n",
    "and never terminate by itself. Data stuck in an infinite loop tends to\n",
    "either infinity or 0, yielding invalid results. To analyze the execution\n",
    "sequence and facilitate model topology design, the following describes\n",
    "the dependencies between the compute nodes in a computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Figure :numref:`ch04/ch04-dependence`, if the Matmul1 operator is\n",
    "removed from the graph, there will be no input to the downstream\n",
    "activation function, and the data flow will be interrupted. We can\n",
    "therefore conclude that the operators in this computational graph depend\n",
    "on each other with transitive relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Computationaldependencies](../img/ch04/dependence.png)\n",
    ":label:`ch04/ch04-dependence`\n",
    "\n",
    "Three types of dependencies are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Direct dependency**: For example, the ReLU1 node is directly\n",
    "    dependent on the Matmul1 node. That is, ReLU1 can run properly only\n",
    "    when it receives a direct output from Matmul1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Indirect dependency**: For example, the Add node indirectly\n",
    "    depends on the Matmul1 node. Specifically, Matmul1's output is\n",
    "    processed by one or more intermediate nodes and then transmitted to\n",
    "    the Add node. The Add node directly or indirectly depends on the\n",
    "    intermediate nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Mutual independence**: For example, the graph shows no\n",
    "    input/output dependency between Matmul1 and Matmul2, meaning that\n",
    "    the two nodes are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the computational graph shown in Figure\n",
    ":numref:`ch04/ch04-recurrent`, the Add node indirectly depends on\n",
    "the Matmul node; conversely, the Matmul node directly depends on the Add\n",
    "node. The two nodes are stuck waiting for each other's output to start\n",
    "their computation. When input data is manually assigned to the two nodes\n",
    "at the same time, they will compute endlessly, and the training process\n",
    "can never terminate by itself. A circular dependency produces a positive\n",
    "feedback data flow, where data values overflow to positive infinity,\n",
    "underflow to negative infinity, or tend to 0. These all lead to\n",
    "unexpected training results. As such, we should avoid circular\n",
    "dependencies between operators when designing deep learning models.\n",

    "represent loop iterations. Figure\n",
    ":numref:`ch04/ch04-recurrent-1` shows a computational graph\n",

    "dependency on that of the previous iteration. In one computational\n",
    "graph, tensors and operators are uniquely identified across the loop\n",
    "iterations, even for the same operation. Unlike circular dependencies,\n",
    "loop iterations do not involve mutual dependencies between operators\n",
    "with unique identifiers. When a subgraph is replicated to produce an\n",

    "## Control Flows\n",
    "\n",
    "A control flow maintains the sequence of computation tasks, thereby\n",
    "facilitating the design of flexible and complex models. By introducing a\n",
    "control flow to a model, we can execute a node iteratively any number of\n",
    "times or skip a node based on specific conditions. Many deep learning\n",

    "models built on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and reinforcement\n",
    "learning rely on recurrence relations and input status conditions to\n",

    "\n",
    "Popular machine learning frameworks provide two major types of control\n",
    "flows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Frontend control flows**: Python control flow statements are used\n",
    "    to implement control decision-making in a computational graph.\n",
    "    Frontend control flows are easy to use in model building. However,\n",
    "    because the computation process of the machine learning framework\n",
    "    runs on the backend hardware and the control flow is decoupled from\n",
    "    the data flow, the computational graph cannot run entirely on the\n",
    "    backend hardware. As such, control flow implementations using the\n",
    "    frontend language are referred to as the *out-of-graph approach*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Framework control primitives**: Machine learning frameworks come\n",
    "    with built-in low-level fine-grained control primitive operators.\n",
    "    Such operators are executable on compute hardware. When they are\n",
    "    introduced to a model, the computational graph can run entirely on\n",
    "    the backend hardware. This type of control flow implementations are\n",
    "    referred to as the *in-graph approach*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain why we need these different approaches to implement control\n",
    "flows, let's look at the differences between the two approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The out-of-graph approach is familiar to Python programmers. This\n",
    "flexible, intuitive approach allows direct use of Python commands such\n",
    "as `if-else`, `while`, and `for` in building control flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The in-graph approach, by contrast, is more complicated. TensorFlow\n",
    "provides a range of in-graph control flow operators (such as `tf.cond`\n",
    "for conditional control, `tf.while_loop` for loop control, and `tf.case`\n",
    "for branch control). These operators are composites of lower-level\n",
    "primitive operators. The control flow representations adopted by the\n",
    "in-graph approach are in a different style from common programming ---\n",
    "this improves computing performance but comes at the expense of\n",
    "usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The out-of-graph approach is easier to use. However, not all backend\n",
    "compute hardware is compatible with the frontend runtime environment,\n",
    "and extra efforts may be needed to execute the frontend control flows.\n",
    "Nevertheless, control flows implemented using the in-graph approach are\n",
    "directly executable on hardware independent of the frontend environment,\n",
    "improving efficiency throughout the model building, optimization, and\n",
    "execution process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two approaches serve different application scenarios. To run tasks\n",
    "such as model training, inference, and deployment on compute hardware\n",
    "independent of the frontend environment, the in-graph approach is\n",
    "recommended for building control flows. For model validation purposes,\n",
    "the out-of-graph approach allows for higher efficiency in generating\n",
    "model code from the model algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major machine learning frameworks support both the out-of-graph and\n",
    "in-graph approaches. In the following illustrations about the impact of\n",
    "control flows on forward and backward computation, we adopt the\n",
    "out-of-graph approach for control flow implementations, given that\n",
    "frontend control flows are more popular in practice. The most common\n",
    "control flows include conditional branches and loops. For a model\n",
