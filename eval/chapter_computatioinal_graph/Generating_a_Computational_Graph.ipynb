    "# Generating a Computational Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we explored the ingredients of a computational\n",
    "graph. Now let's proceed to the next question --- how is a computational\n",
    "graph automatically generated? Machine learning frameworks support two\n",
    "approaches to implementing computational graphs: static and dynamic. The\n",
    "static approach builds a static (unchanging) graph based on information\n",
    "such as the network topology and parameter variables described by the\n",
    "frontend language. Because frontend languages are independent, static\n",
    "graphs are especially suitable for model deployment (e.g., deploying a\n",
    "facial recognition application on mobile devices).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the static approach, the dynamic approach dynamically generates a\n",
    "temporary graph based on the frontend description each time the model is\n",
    "executed. Dynamic graphs are easy to debug, making it possible to\n",
    "fine-tune models efficiently on the fly. Major machine learning\n",
    "frameworks such as TensorFlow and MindSpore are compatible with both\n",
    "approaches. And although PyTorch uses dynamic graphs, it also offers\n",
    "dynamic-to-static conversion support for efficient model execution. To\n",
    "choose the right approach for a specific task, we need to consider the\n",
    "task requirements as well as the pros and cons of each approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Static Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The static graph approach decouples the definition and execution\n",
    "processes. That is, a static graph is compiled before it is executed, as\n",
    "shown in Figure :numref:`ch04/ch04-static`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Generating and executing a staticgraph](../img/ch04/static.png)\n",
    ":label:`ch04/ch04-static`\n",
    "\n",
    "When a model program is generated using the frontend language, the\n",
    "machine learning framework first analyzes the model topology for\n",
    "information such as the connections between network layers, parameter\n",
    "variable settings, and loss functions. The framework then compiles the\n",
    "model description into fixed code (i.e., a static computational graph)\n",
    "that can be invoked and executed by the computing backend. In this case,\n",
    "subsequent training or inference on this model is no longer\n",
    "frontend-dependent. Specifically, when input data is fed into the static\n",
    "graph, the operators in the graph are directly scheduled to hardware for\n",
    "execution. And to improve hardware computational efficiency, we can also\n",
    "convert a static graph into other equivalent structures through various\n",
    "optimization strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code `ch04/code4` shows an example of generating and executing a\n",
    "simple static graph. In the frontend definition phase, some machine\n",
    "learning frameworks require developers to declare predefined\n",
    "configuration items including tensor placeholders, loss functions,\n",
    "optimization functions, network building and runtime environments, and\n",
    "network executors, as well as in-graph control statements using control\n",
    "flow operators. The design of machine learning frameworks has recently\n",
    "been improved to provide easy-to-use APIs and a unified model building\n",
    "paradigm. For example, MindSpore enables unified frontend programming\n",
    "representations featuring dynamic and static integration. To illustrate,\n",
    "let's consider the following simple model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ch04/code4**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def model(X, flag):\n",
    "    if flag > 0:     \n",
    "        Y = matmul(W1, X)   \n",
    "    else:     \n",
    "        Y = matmul(W2, X)\n",
    "    Y = Y + b\n",
    "    Y = relu(Y)\n",
    "    return Y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning framework does not load input data when generating\n",
    "a static graph. Instead, *placeholder* tensors are used to hold places\n",
    "of input data. In the static graph defined in Code\n",
    "`ch04/code4`, we need to create a placeholder for input\n",
    "$\\bf{X}$ in line 1. Because no actual input is fed into the model during\n",
    "static graph generation, the control flow defined in line 2 cannot make\n",
    "control decisions at build time. As such, we need to add the control\n",
    "flow operator and the computational subgraph of each branch to the\n",
    "static graph. When the model receives actual inputs during runtime,\n",
    "different branches are taken (by running the corresponding computational\n",

    "learning frameworks are able to compile Python control flows as their\n",
    "static graph equivalents. In order to implement control flows in this\n",
    "case, we can use the control primitives provided by the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Generating a staticgraph](../img/ch04/static_gen.png)\n",
    ":label:`ch04/ch04-static-gen`\n",
    "\n",
    "Static computational graphs offer two distinct advantages. First, they\n",
    "yield better performance with less memory. When building a static graph,\n",
    "the machine learning framework acquires the complete model topology\n",
    "containing global information of the model, which facilitates the\n",
    "formulation of graph optimization strategies (e.g., the operator fusion\n",
    "strategy that fuses two or more operators into a larger one). As shown\n",
    "in Figure :numref:`ch04/ch04-static-gen`, the Add and ReLU operators are\n",
    "fused into one operator to reduce the loads/stores of intermediate\n",
    "results and low-level scheduling overhead, thereby improving the\n",
    "execution performance and efficiency with a lower memory footprint.\n",
    "Static graphs allow for many optimization strategies at build time,\n",
    "which we will discuss in later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, by converting static graphs into executable code within the\n",
    "machine learning framework, we can directly deploy our models on various\n",
    "hardware platforms to provide efficient inference services. Also, we can\n",
    "store static graphs using serialization techniques for future execution\n",
    "(either model training or inference), eliminating the need to rebuild\n",
    "the frontend source code from scratch every time before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the frontend code of the model is compiled into a static graph, the\n",
    "graph structure is fixed. If we introduce any optimizations to the\n",
    "graph, the optimized code can differ significantly from the original.\n",
    "However, the optimized code is not intuitively visible, meaning that it\n",
    "is sometimes impossible to locate a runtime error based on the returned\n",
    "code line number in the optimized code. Consider a simple case. Assuming\n",
    "that the Add and ReLU operators in Code\n",
    "`ch04/code4` have been fused for optimization, if a runtime\n",
    "error related to the fused operator is reported, it would be hard for us\n",
    "to determine the exact error location (Add or ReLU).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, in the daunting process of model debugging and testing,\n",
    "intermediate results cannot be printed in real time. To make this\n",
    "happen, we need to insert additional code to the source code and then\n",
    "recompile the source code for execution, making debugging less\n",
    "efficient. By contrast, the dynamic graph approach offers more\n",
    "flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure :numref:`ch04/ch04-eager1` shows the principle of the dynamic\n",
    "graph approach. A dynamic graph is defined as it runs. The frontend\n",
    "interpreter parses the graph code and the machine learning framework\n",
    "distributes the operators in the graph to the backend for just-in-time\n",
    "(JIT) execution. Adopting the user-friendly imperative programming\n",
    "paradigm, the dynamic graph approach allows developers to create neural\n",
    "network models at the frontend and is therefore favored by a vast number\n",
    "of deep learning researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Dynamic graph principle](../img/ch04/eager.png)\n",
    ":label:`ch04/ch04-eager1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we reuse the pseudocode in the previous section to compare the\n",
    "dynamic and static graph approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these two approaches differ only slightly in their frontend\n",
    "representations, they differ dramatically in terms of their compilation\n",
    "and execution mechanisms. Unlike the static graph approach, the dynamic\n",
    "graph approach calls the built-in operator distribution function of the\n",
    "machine learning framework through the Python API to distribute Python\n",
    "operators to the hardware backend (e.g., CPU, GPU, or NPU) for\n",
    "accelerated computing, which then returns the computational result to\n",
    "the frontend. This process does not generate a static computational\n",
    "graph. Instead, the framework describes the model topology using the\n",
    "frontend language, schedules and executes the model based on\n",
    "computational dependencies, and dynamically generates a temporary graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure :numref:`ch04/ch04-dynamic-gen` shows the process of generating a\n",
    "dynamic graph.\n",
    "\n",

    ":label:`ch04/ch04-dynamic-gen`\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward computation is run through the neural network in the sequence\n",
    "defined by the model declaration. Once the model receives input\n",
    "$\\bf{X}$, the machine learning framework starts to generate a dynamic\n",
    "graph by adding the input node to the graph and sending the data to the\n",
    "downstream node. The control flow (if available) makes a data flow\n",
    "decision immediately. For example, in Figure\n",
    ":numref:`ch04/ch04-dynamic-gen`, if the conditional returns true,\n",
    "only the Matmul operator node with respect to tensor $\\bf{W1}$ is added\n",
    "to the graph. Then, the machine learning framework inserts the Add and\n",
    "ReLU operator nodes based on the operator sequence and computational\n",
    "dependencies defined in the code. For each newly added operator node,\n",
    "the machine learning framework distributes and executes the operator,\n",
    "returns the computational result, and prepares to pass the result to the\n",
    "next node. When forward computation resumes, the last dynamic graph\n",
    "becomes invalid and a new dynamic graph is created according to current\n",
    "input and control decision. In contrast with a static graph that\n",
    "represents the entire model described in the frontend language, a\n",
    "dynamic graph is generated on the fly as the control flow and data flow\n",
    "evolve over time. For this reason, the machine learning framework has\n",
    "few opportunities to optimize the model in the dynamic graph setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the static graph setting, as the model definition is entirely\n",
    "available, a complete forward computational graph and a complete\n",
    "backward computational graph can be constructed simultaneously. However,\n",
    "in the dynamic graph setting, gradients are calculated for\n",
    "backpropagation as the forward pass proceeds. Specifically, the machine\n",
    "learning framework collects information of each backward operator and\n",
    "tensor participating in gradient computation based on the information of\n",
    "each operator called in the forward pass. Once the forward pass ends,\n",
    "the operator and tensor information for backpropagation becomes\n",
    "available. With this information, the machine learning framework creates\n",
    "a backward computational graph and runs it on hardware to complete\n",
    "gradient computation and parameter update.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Figure :numref:`ch04/ch04-dynamic-gen`, when the Matmul operator with\n",
    "respect to tensor $\\bf{W1}$ is called, the framework runs the Matmul\n",
    "operator to calculate the product of inputs $\\bf{X}$ and $\\bf{W1}$, and\n",
    "then records the operator and tensor $\\bf{X}$ that will participate in\n",
    "backpropagation based on the backward computation process\n",
    "Grad\\_$\\bf{W1}$=Grad\\_$\\bf{Y}*\\bf{X}$, thereby completing the forward\n",
    "pass and producing a backward computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the optimization techniques useful in the static graph setting\n",
    "do not work for dynamic graphs (because the complete network structure\n",
    "is unknown until the dynamic graph runs), researchers and developers can\n",
    "easily analyze errors and debug results during model testing and\n",
    "optimization. This is made possible by dynamic graphs supporting JIT\n",
    "computing and returning computational results immediately with the\n",
    "execution of each statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the dynamic graph approach enables flexible execution using native\n",
    "control flows provided by the frontend --- unlike static graphs, which\n",
    "involve complex control flows along with programming and debugging\n",
