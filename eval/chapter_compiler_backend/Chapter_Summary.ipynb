    "\n",
    "1.  The compiler backend performs three primary tasks: graph\n",
    "    optimization, operator selection, and memory allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Graph optimization reduces resource overhead, adapts the graph to\n",
    "    hardware capabilities, and enhances execution performance while\n",
    "    maintaining the model's numerical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Graph optimization techniques can be hardware-agnostic (e.g., memory\n",
    "    I/O optimization) or hardware-specific (e.g., subgraph\n",
    "    transformation to adapt to hardware instruction restrictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Operator selection involves mapping the compute nodes in an IR to\n",
    "    suitable operators for hardware execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  When selecting an optimized operator, factors such as data format\n",
    "    and type must be considered, as they impact operator performance on\n",
    "    the target hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  An IR is generated after graph optimization and operator selection.\n",
    "    Based on the IR, memory is allocated for input and output tensors of\n",
    "    each operator before launching them to hardware for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Memory reuse is designed to improve memory utilization and\n",
    "    accommodate larger models within limited device memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  Fusion of communication operators enhances communication efficiency.\n",
    "    Properly allocating memory for in-place operators reduces memory\n",
    "    footprint and improves computing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  Operator compilers play a vital role in optimizing hardware\n",
    "    performance. Critical optimization techniques include scheduling\n",
    "    strategies and the polyhedral model algorithm.\n"
