    "# Case Study: Using ROS\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will guide you through the process of installing ROS\n",
    "2 and configuring the environment. We will also provide a few code\n",
    "examples to deepen your understanding of ROS 2 usage and concepts\n",
    "introduced in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our environment consists of the following: ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy, the\n",
    "latest ROS 2 long-term support (LTS) release at the time of writing;\n",
    "Ubuntu Focal 20.04; and Python 3.8 (our examples use Python 3.8.10)\n",
    "installed in Ubuntu Focal. Ubuntu Focal is the official software for\n",
    "installing ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy. If you install ROS 2 via Debian packages\n",
    "(recommended), you must use the version of Python 3 on Ubuntu. This is\n",
    "because many Python dependencies of ROS 2 will be automatically\n",
    "installed in the Python 3 path on Ubuntu via `apt install` (instead of\n",
    "via `pip install`). In other words, when you select the ROS 2 version,\n",
    "the versions of Ubuntu and Python you need are automatically determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use a Python virtual environment, you must also use the\n",
    "Python interpreter provided by Ubuntu and add the `site-packages` option\n",
    "during the creation stage because we need the ROS 2 dependencies\n",
    "installed in the Python 3 path.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a pipenv user can use the following command to create a\n",
    "virtual environment that uses the installed Python 3 and has\n",
    "`site-packages`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pipenv --python $(/usr/bin/python3 -V | cut -d\" \" -f2) --site-packages\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to Python 3 being installed, virtual environments created with conda\n",
    "may experience some compatibility issues. Other versions of ROS 2 are\n",
    "installed and operate in essentially the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section and subsequent cases, we may use ROS 2, Ubuntu, and\n",
    "Python to refer to ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy, Ubuntu Focal, and Python 3.8,\n",
    "respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cases in this section can be found in the ROS 2 official tutorial, which\n",
    "is very detailed and ideal for ROS 2 beginners. You can learn more about\n",
    "ROS 2 there.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Installing ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the official tutorial makes it relatively easy to install ROS\n",
    "2 on Ubuntu (e.g., installing ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy and Ubuntu Focal). The\n",
    "installation procedure of ROS 2 described in this section is primarily\n",
    "based on this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setting the system to support the UTF-8 locale**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before installation, ensure that the Ubuntu system locale is set to a\n",
    "value that supports UTF-8. You can check the current locale settings via\n",
    "the locale command. If the value of `LANG` ends with `.UTF-8`, the\n",
    "system already supports the UTF-8 locale. Otherwise, use the following\n",
    "commands to set it as the UTF-8 value in English (US). You can change\n",
    "the language code to match your desired language.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales\n",
    "sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8\n",
    "sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n",
    "export LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setting the software source**\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to add the software source of ROS 2 to the system by\n",
    "running the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg2 lsb-release\n",
    "sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key  -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(source /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Installing ROS 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the preceding steps are complete, update the software source cache\n",
    "and then install the ROS 2 Desktop version. This is the preferred\n",
    "version because it contains the ROS 2 framework and most of the software\n",
    "libraries commonly used in ROS 2 development, such as rviz.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, install colcon (a build tool for ROS 2) and rosdep (which\n",
    "can help us quickly install a dependency required by the ROS 2 project).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt-get install python3-colcon-common-extensions python3-rosdep\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have installed ROS 2. However, an additional step is required to\n",
    "set up the environment before using ROS 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Setting the environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "For any installed version of ROS 2 (and ROS), you need to set up the\n",
    "required environment by sourcing the corresponding `setup` script before\n",
    "using the version. For example, for the newly installed ROS 2 Foxy\n",
    "Fitzroy, you can run the following command in the terminal to set up the\n",
    "environment required by ROS 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a shell other than `bash`, you may need to change the\n",
    "file name extension of `setup` to the name of the corresponding shell.\n",
    "For example, if you are using zsh, you would need to run the command\n",
    "`source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.zsh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid entering preceding command every time you use ROS 2, you can\n",
    "add this command to your `.bashrc` file (or `.zshrc` and other\n",
    "corresponding shell files). This way, every new command-line terminal\n",
    "you build will be automatically set to the environment that ROS 2\n",
    "requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of following this process to set up the environment is\n",
    "that you can install multiple versions of ROS 2 (and ROS), and then\n",
    "source the `setup.bash` file of the corresponding version when you use\n",
    "it without interference from other versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a heavy user of Python, adding `setup.bash` to `.bashrc` may\n",
    "cause issues. This is because all your virtual environments will\n",
    "automatically introduce the environment setup of ROS 2, and the Python\n",
    "libraries in ROS 2 will be added to the paths of your virtual\n",
    "environments. Although virtual environments may detect ROS 2 libraries,\n",
    "those libraries will not be used or disrupt the program operation in\n",
    "your virtual environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid such issues, if you plan to develop a ROS 2 project primarily\n",
    "using Python, you can create a virtual environment for the project and\n",
    "add `source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash` to the `activate` script of the\n",
    "virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you may need to add this `source` command to the very\n",
    "beginning or close to the end of the script. (If, for example, you are a\n",
    "pipenv user, you need to add this command before the\n",
    "`hash -r 2>/dev/null` command instead of putting it at the end.)\n",
    "Otherwise, the following error may occur when you activate the virtual\n",
    "environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Shell for UNKNOWN_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT already activated.\n",
    "No action taken to avoid nested environments.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Testing the installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "After you run the `source` command, you can test whether ROS 2 is\n",
    "successfully installed and the environment is set up correctly. You can\n",
    "execute `printenv | grep -i R̂OS` on the command line where the `source`\n",
    "command is executed. The output should contain the following three\n",
    "environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ROS_VERSION=2\n",
    "ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3\n",
    "ROS_DISTRO=foxy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you can open another two terminal windows that have\n",
    "executed the `source` command, and then execute\n",
    "Code `code/ch17/code_terminal_1` on terminal 1 and\n",
    "Code `code/ch17/code_terminal_2` on terminal 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**code/ch17/code_terminal_1**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**code/ch17/code_terminal_2**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the installation was successful and the `source` command is executed,\n",
    "`talker` shows that it is broadcasting messages, and `listener` shows\n",
    "that it has heard the messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you have now successfully installed ROS 2 and set up\n",
    "the environment. The following sections will provide a few examples to\n",
    "illustrate the core concepts of ROS 2 introduced in the previous\n",
    "section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Node Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this subsection, we will create a ROS 2 project and use Python to\n",
    "write an example of `Hello World` to show the basic structure of ROS 2\n",
    "nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Creating a new ROS 2 project**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create a folder in an appropriate location. This folder will be\n",
    "the root directory of the ROS 2 project, that is, the \"workspace\"\n",
    "introduced in the previous section. Because this workspace is manually\n",
    "created, it is an overlay workspace. In contrast, the `source` command\n",
    "executed earlier will help you prepare the underlay workspace on which\n",
    "the overlay workplace is based.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you create a workspace and name it as `openmlsys-ros2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir openmlsys-ros2\n",
    "cd openmlsys-ros2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you then need to create a Python virtual environment for\n",
    "the workspace and add the `source` command to the corresponding\n",
    "`activate` script, as described in the previous subsection about\n",
    "environment setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, all commands in the case study subsections are executed in\n",
    "this newly built virtual environment. Because different tools for\n",
    "managing virtual environments have different commands, we do not provide\n",
    "examples of executable commands here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, create a subfolder named `src` in this workspace folder. Within\n",
    "this subfolder, create different ROS 2 packages. They are independent of\n",
    "each other, but can call each other's functions to meet the requirements\n",
    "of the entire ROS 2 project.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `src` subfolder is created, call the `colcon build` command,\n",
    "which is a common build tool for ROS 2. This command attempts to build\n",
    "the entire ROS 2 project (i.e., all packages in the current workspace).\n",
    "After this command is executed successfully, three new folders will be\n",
    "created in the workspace: `build`, `install`, and `log`. `build`\n",
    "includes the intermediate outputs, `install` contains the final outputs\n",
    "(i.e., well-built packages) of the build process, and `log` stores the\n",
    "process logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, with this new framework for the ROS 2 project, you are\n",
    "ready to start coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Creating a Python package under the ROS 2 framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `src` folder, create a ROS 2 package where you will write the\n",
    "case of `Hello World`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd src\n",
    "ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy std_msgs --node-name hello_world_node my_hello_world\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`pkg create` in the `ros2` command can help you quickly create a\n",
    "framework for the ROS 2 package. The `build-type` parameter indicates\n",
    "that this is a pure Python package, and the `dependencies` parameter\n",
    "indicates that the package will use two dependencies --- `rclpy` and\n",
    "`std_msgs`. The `node-name` parameter shows that the package created has\n",
    "a ROS 2 node named `hello_world_node`, and that `my_hello_world` at the\n",
    "end is the name of the new package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the new package folder `my_hello_world`. Once the preceding\n",
    "command is executed, a Python package folder named `my_hello_world` is\n",
    "created. It is named after the package and contains files of\n",
    "`__init__.py` and `hello_world_node.py`. The latter exists because you\n",
    "use the `node_name` parameter. This is the Python package folder in\n",
    "which you will write your Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are another two folders: `resource` and `test`. The former helps\n",
    "ROS 2 locate the Python package, and can be ignored. The latter is used\n",
    "to accommodate all the test code, and it already contains three test\n",
    "files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these three folders, there are three files:\n",
    "`package.xml`, `setup.cfg`, and `setup.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`package.xml` is the standard configuration file for the ROS 2 package.\n",
    "In contains a lot of pre-generated content. However, you still need to\n",
    "fill in or update the content in `version`, `description`, `maintainer`,\n",
    "and `license`. You are advised to fill in all content completely each\n",
    "time you create a ROS 2 package. In addition, `rclpy` and `std_msgs` are\n",
    "listed as dependencies because you used the `dependencies` parameter. To\n",
    "add or modify dependencies, you can directly modify the `depend` list in\n",
    "`package.xml`. In addition to the most commonly used `depend` (for\n",
    "`build`, `export`, and `execution`), you also have `build_depend`,\n",
    "`build_export_depend`, `exec_depend`, `test_depend`, `buildtool_depend`,\n",
    "and `dec_depend`. For details about `package.xml`, see the Wiki page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `setup.cfg` and `setup.py` are files related to the Python package.\n",
    "However, ROS 2 also uses them to learn how to install the Python package\n",
    "to the `install` folder and what entry points --- programs that can be\n",
    "directly called by the ROS 2 command-line commands --- need to be\n",
    "registered. Notice that the name `hello_world_node` has been set to\n",
    "`my_hello_world/hello_world_node.py` --- the alias of the `main()`\n",
    "function in the Python file --- in `console_scripts`, a subitem of\n",
    "`entry_points` in `setup.py`. You can call this function directly later\n",
    "using the ROS 2 command-line commands and this new name as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# ros2 run <package_name> <entry_point>\n",
    "ros2 run my_hello_world hello_world_node\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a new entry point, you can directly add it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the entry points, you should promptly update the items of\n",
    "`version`, `maintainer`, `maintainer_email`, `description`, and\n",
    "`license` in `setup.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. First ROS 2 node**\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the Python file `my_hello_world/hello_world_node.py` and delete its\n",
    "content in order to write the desired code.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, introduce the necessary packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import rclpy\n",
    "from rclpy.node import Node\n",
    "from std_msgs.msg import String\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`rclpy` --- ROS Client Library for Python --- allows you to use various\n",
    "functions within the ROS 2 framework through Python. The `Node` class is\n",
    "the base class for all ROS 2 nodes. Your node class also needs to\n",
    "inherit this base class. `std_msgs` contains some standard message\n",
    "formats predefined by ROS 2 for intra-framework communication. You need\n",
    "to use the `String` message format to pass string information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, define your own ROS 2 node:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class HelloWorldNode(Node):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super().__init__('my_hello_world_node')\n",
    "        self.msg_publisher = self.create_publisher(String, 'hello_world_topic', 10)\n",
    "        timer_period = 1.\n",
    "        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)\n",
    "        self.count = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def timer_callback(self):\n",
    "        msg = String()\n",
    "        msg.data = f'Hello World: {self.count}'\n",
    "        self.msg_publisher.publish(msg)\n",
    "        self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: \"{msg.data}\"')\n",
    "        self.count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, your node class `HelloWorldNode` inherits from the\n",
    "`Node` base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `__init__()` method, call the initialization method of the base\n",
    "class to name your node as `my_hello_world_node`. Next, create an\n",
    "information publisher that publishes the information of the string type\n",
    "to the topic `hello_world_topic` and maintains a buffer of size 10.\n",
    "Then, create a timer that calls the `timer_callback()` method once every\n",
    "second. Finally, initialize a counter to count the total number of\n",
    "messages that have been published.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `timer_callback()` method, create a simple message of\n",
    "`Hello World` with a counter and send it through the message publisher.\n",
    "Then log the operation and increment the count by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `Hello World` node class is defined, start defining the\n",
    "`main()` function, which is the entry point in `setup.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main(args=None):\n",
    "    rclpy.init(args=args)\n",
    "    hello_world_node = HelloWorldNode()\n",
    "    rclpy.spin(hello_world_node)\n",
    "    hello_world_node.destroy_node()\n",
    "    rclpy.shutdown()\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This `main()` function is relatively simple. First, start the ROS 2\n",
    "framework with the `rclpy.init()` method. Then, create an instance of\n",
    "`HelloWorldNode` and add it to the running ROS 2 framework by means of\n",
    "`rclpy.spin()`. This ensures that the instance participates in the ROS 2\n",
    "event loop and runs correctly. `rclpy.spin()` is a blocking method that\n",
    "runs continually until it is blocked (e.g., when the ROS 2 framework\n",
    "stops running). At this time, your node will be destroyed and the ROS 2\n",
    "framework closed. If you do not destroy an unused node, the garbage\n",
    "collector will destroy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you have created your first ROS 2 node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. First build and run**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now ready to build the new package. This involves installing the\n",
    "Python package you have written into a place where ROS 2 can find it\n",
    "rather than building a Python project.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# cd <workspace>\n",
    "cd openmlsys-ros2\n",
    "colcon build --symlink-install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this build command will build all Python and C++ packages in the\n",
    "`src` folder in the workspace and then install them in the `install`\n",
    "folder. The `–symlink-install` option requires `colcon` to build\n",
    "`symlink` for the Python package so that installation is not replicated.\n",
    "In this way, any subsequent changes in `src` will be reflected directly\n",
    "in `install`, instead of repeatedly executing the build command.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the build is completed successfully, the package is still not\n",
    "ready to be used yet. For example, executing\n",
    "`ros2 run my_hello_world hello_world_node` now will likely result in the\n",
    "message `Package ’my_hello_world’ not found`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the package, you need to let ROS 2 know where the `install`\n",
    "folder is. Source the `local_setup.bash` file in the `install` folder as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source install/local_setup.bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike earlier when we added `setup.bash` to the `activate` script in\n",
    "the virtual environment in order to eliminate the need for sourcing the\n",
    "file separately each time, we cannot do the same with\n",
    "`install/local_setup.bash`. Doing so would cause a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, to run the ROS 2 package, you have to source both\n",
    "`setup.bash` and `install/local_setup.bash` (either through the\n",
    "`activate` script or manually). However, the condition of building the\n",
    "pure Python ROS 2 package with C++ dependencies is sourcing only\n",
    "`setup.bash` but not `local_setup.bash`. Subsequent cases will show such\n",
    "a condition for a pure Python ROS 2 package that uses the package of\n",
    "custom message interfaces (your own C++ package).\n",
    "\n",
    "After successfully sourcing `install/local_setup.bash`, you can call the\n",
    "written node.\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, unless otherwise specified, `setup.bash` and\n",
    "`install/local_setup.bash` in any newly created window are sourced and\n",
    "the `colcon build` command is executed in a terminal window where only\n",
    "`setup.bash` is sourced and `install/local_setup.bash` is ignored.\n",

    "and the initial value of this parameter is `world`.\\\n",
    "(2) The new class attempts to obtain the actual value of the `name`\n",

    "## Server-Client Service Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous section, the ROS 2 framework has both a\n",
    "publisher-subscriber communication mode and a server-client\n",
    "communication mode. In this subsection, we will use a simple service\n",
    "that concatenates two strings to demonstrate how the server-client mode\n",
    "works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Custom service interfaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before coding for the server and client, you need to define the\n",
    "communication interfaces between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of interfaces in the ROS 2 framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The message/msg interface for nodes in publisher-subscriber mode: It is\n",
    "used for unidirectional message delivery and only defines the format of\n",
    "such messages. The service/srv interface for service nodes in\n",
    "server-client mode: It is used for bidirectional message delivery and\n",
    "defines the format of the requests sent from the client to the server\n",
    "and the format of the responses sent from the server to the client. The\n",
    "action interface for action nodes in action mode: It is used for\n",
    "bidirectional message delivery and intermediate progress feedback. It\n",
    "defines the format of the requests sent by the action initiating node to\n",
    "the action node, the format of the results sent by the action node to\n",
    "the action initiating node, and the format of the intermediate progress\n",
    "feedback sent by the action node to the action initiating node. The\n",
    "`std_msgs.msg.String` message interface in the predefined package\n",
    "`std_msgs` is used for the `HelloWorld` nodes defined earlier. Because\n",
    "the message interface is only responsible for defining the format of\n",
    "unidirectional messages, predefined interface types are readily\n",
    "available. For services and actions, however, you need to define an\n",
    "interface type because the interfaces are responsible for defining the\n",
    "format of bidirectional communications. Next, let's define the service\n",
    "type interface for the string concatenation service.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create a new package in the `src` folder of the workspace, which\n",
    "is dedicated to maintaining custom message, service, and action\n",
    "interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd openmlsys-ros2/src\n",
    "ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake my_interfaces\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a new C++ package, not a Python one, because custom interface\n",
    "types of ROS 2 can only support C++ packages. Once you have created the\n",
    "package, update the related items in `package.xml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate maintenance, custom interfaces are generally placed in the\n",
    "corresponding subfolders. As such, you can create three subfolders in\n",
    "the new folder `src/my_interfaces`: `msg`, `srv`, and `action`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd my_interfaces\n",
    "mkdir msg srv action\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, create the service interfaces you want to define in the `srv`\n",
    "subfolder.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd srv\n",
    "touch ConcatTwoStr.srv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, add the following contents to `ConcatTwoStr.srv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "string str1\n",
    "string str2\n",
    "---\n",
    "string ret\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents above - - - are the format of the requests sent by the\n",
    "client to the server, and those below are the format of the responses\n",
    "sent by the server to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the interfaces are defined, you also need to modify\n",
    "`CMakeLists.txt`. Open `my_interfaces/CMakeLists.txt` and add the\n",
    "following code before the line `if(BUILD_TESTING)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)\n",
    "\n",
    "rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}\n",

    "The code above instructs the build tool to find the required\n",
    "`rosidl_default_generators` package and to build the custom interfaces\n",
    "you specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "After updating `CMakeLists.txt`, you also need to add\n",
    "`rosidl_default_generators` to `package.xml` as a dependency of the\n",
    "custom interface package. Open the `package.xml` file and add the\n",
    "following code before the line\n",
