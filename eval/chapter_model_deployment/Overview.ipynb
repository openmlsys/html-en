    "After training a model, we need to save it and its parameters to files\n",
    "to make them persistent. However, because different training frameworks\n",
    "adopt different data structures for such files, the inference system\n",
    "must support models trained using different training frameworks and\n",
    "convert the data in the files into a unified data structure. During the\n",
    "conversion from a training model to an inference model, optimization\n",
    "operations such as operator fusion and constant folding on the model can\n",
    "be performed to improve the inference performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardware restrictions of different production environments must be\n",
    "considered when we deploy an inference model. For instance, a\n",
    "large-scale model needs to be deployed on a server in a computing or\n",
    "data center with strong computing power, whereas a mid-scale model\n",
    "should be deployed on an edge server, PC, or smartphone --- such devices\n",
    "often have limited computing resources and memory. For simple,\n",
    "small-scale models, ultra-low power microcontrollers can be used. In\n",
    "addition, different hardware supports different data types (such as\n",
    "float32, float16, bfloat16, and int8). To adapt to the hardware\n",
    "restrictions, a trained model may sometimes need to be compressed in\n",
    "order to reduce model complexity or data precision and reduce model\n",
    "parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a model can be used for inference, it needs to be deployed in the\n",
    "runtime environment. To optimize model inference, which may be affected\n",
    "by latency, memory usage, and power consumption, we can design chips\n",
    "dedicated for machine learning --- such dedicated chips usually\n",
    "outperform general-purpose ones in terms of energy efficiency. Another\n",
    "approach is to fully leverage hardware capabilities through\n",
    "software-hardware collaboration. Take a CPU as an example. When\n",
    "designing and optimizing models for a specific CPU architecture, we can\n",
    "suitably divide data blocks to meet the cache size, rearrange data to\n",
    "facilitate contiguous data access during computing, reduce data\n",
    "dependency to improve the parallelism of hardware pipelines, and use\n",
    "extended instruction sets to improve the computing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because models are an important enterprise asset, it is important to\n",
    "ensure their security after they are deployed in the runtime\n",
    "environment. This chapter will discuss some of the common protection\n",
    "measures and use model obfuscation as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the common methods used in the industry to address the preceding\n",
    "challenges are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Model compression:** Technologies that reduce the model size and\n",
    "    computation complexity by means of quantization and pruning. Such\n",
    "    technologies can be categorized according to whether retraining is\n",
    "    required.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Operator fusion:** Technologies that combine multiple operators\n",
    "    into one by simplifying expressions and fusing attributes, aiming to\n",
    "    reduce the computation complexity and size of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Constant folding:** Forward computation of operators that meet\n",
    "    certain conditions is completed in the offline phase, reducing the\n",
    "    computation complexity and size of a model. This requires that the\n",
    "    inputs of operators be constants in the offline phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Data format:** According to the operator library and hardware\n",
    "    restrictions and exploration of the optimal data format of each\n",
    "    layer on the network, data is rearranged or data rearrangement\n",
    "    operators are inserted, in order to reduce the inference latency\n",
    "    during model deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Model obfuscation:** Network nodes or branches are added and\n",
    "    operator names are changed for a trained model, so that it is\n",
    "    difficult for attackers to understand the original model structure\n",
    "    even if they steal the model. An obfuscated model may be directly\n",
    "    executed in the deployment environment, thereby ensuring the\n",
    "    security of the model during execution.\n"
