    "# Distributed Reinforcement Learning System\n",
    "\n",
    "The distributed reinforcement learning system is more powerful than the\n",
    "single-node reinforcement system we discussed earlier. It features\n",
    "parallel processing capability of multiple models in multiple\n",
    "environments, meaning it can update multiple models on multiple computer\n",
    "systems at the same time. As such, it significantly accelerates the\n",
    "learning process and improves the overall performance of the\n",
    "reinforcement learning system. This section focuses on common algorithms\n",
    "and systems in distributed reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distributed RL Algorithm--A3C\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) was proposed by DeepMind\n",
    "researchers in 2016. This algorithm can update networks on multiple\n",
    "computing devices in parallel. Unlike the single-node reinforcement\n",
    "learning system, A3C creates a group of workers, allocates the workers\n",
    "to different computing devices, and creates an interactive environment\n",
    "for each worker to implement parallel sampling and model update. In\n",
    "addition, it uses a master node to update actor networks (policy\n",
    "networks) and critic networks (value networks). These two types of\n",
    "networks correspond to the policy and value functions in reinforcement\n",
    "learning, respectively. Such a design allows each worker to send the\n",
    "gradients computed based on the collected samples to the master node in\n",
    "real time in order to update the parameters on the master node. The\n",
    "parameters are then transferred in real time to each worker for model\n",
    "synchronization. Each worker can perform the computing on a GPU. In this\n",
    "way, the entire algorithm updates the model in parallel on a GPU\n",
    "cluster. Figure :numref:`ch011/ch11-a3c` depicts the algorithm structure.\n",
    "Research shows that in addition to accelerating model learning,\n",
    "distributed reinforcement learning helps stabilize learning performance.\n",
    "This is because the gradients in distributed reinforcement learning are\n",
    "computed based on environment sampled from multiple nodes.\n",

    "## Distributed RL Algorithm--IMPALA\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture (IMPALA) is a\n",
    "reinforcement learning framework proposed by Lasse Espeholt et al. in\n",
    "2018 to implement clustered multi-machine training. Figure\n",
    ":numref:`ch011/ch11-impala` depicts this architecture. Like A3C,\n",
    "IMPALA enables gradient computation on multiple GPUs in parallel. In\n",
    "IMPALA, multiple actors and learners are paralleled. Each actor has a\n",
    "policy network to collect samples by interacting with another\n",
    "environment. The collected sample trajectories are sent by actors to\n",
    "their respective learners for gradient computation. Among the learners,\n",
    "there is a master learner. It can communicate with other learners to\n",
    "obtain their computed gradients for the update of its model. After the\n",
    "model is updated, the model is delivered to other learners and actors\n",
    "for a new round of sampling and gradient computation. As a distributed\n",
    "computing architecture, IMPALA is proved to be more efficient than A3C.\n",
    "It benefits from a specially designed gradient computation function in\n",
    "learners and from V-trace target in addition to stabilizing training\n",
    "based on importance weights. Because the V-trace technique is not\n",
    "related to our area of focus here, we will not elaborate on it.\n",
    "Interested readers can learn more from the original paper.\n",

    "## Other Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from A3C and IMPALA, researchers have proposed other algorithms in\n",
    "recent studies, for example, SEED  and Ape-X . These algorithms are more\n",
    "effective in distributed reinforcement learning. Readers can find out\n",
    "more about these algorithms from the corresponding papers. Next, we move\n",
    "on to some typical distributed reinforcement learning algorithm\n",

    "## Distributed RL System -- RLlib\n",
    "\n",
    "RLlib  --- based on Ray , which is a distributed computing framework\n",
    "initiated by several researchers from UC Berkeley --- is built for\n",
    "reinforcement learning. It is an open-source reinforcement learning\n",
    "framework oriented to industrial applications. RLlib contains a\n",
    "reinforcement learning algorithm library and is convenient for users who\n",
    "are not that experienced in reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure :numref:`ch011/ch11-rllib-arch` shows the architecture of RLlib.\n",
    "Its bottom layer is built on Ray's basic components for distributed\n",
    "computing and communications. Oriented to reinforcement learning, basic\n",
    "components such as Trainer, Environment, and Policy are abstracted at\n",
    "the Python layer. There are built-in implementations for the abstracted\n",
    "components, and users can extend the components based on their algorithm\n",
    "requirements. With these built-in and customized algorithm components,\n",
    "researchers can quickly implement specific reinforcement learning\n",

    "Reinforcement learning is usually based on deep neural networks. For\n",
    "distributed learning based on such networks, we can combine RLlib with a\n",
    "deep learning framework such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. Adopting such an\n",

    "\n",
    "For management of experience replay buffer, Reverb  is an inevitable\n",
    "topic. At the beginning of this chapter, we introduced concepts such as\n",
    "state, action, and reward in reinforcement learning. The data used for\n",
    "training in real-world applications comes from the data samples stored\n",
    "in the experience buffer, and the operations performed on the data may\n",
    "vary depending on the data formats. Common data operations include\n",
    "concatenation, truncation, product, transposition, partial product, and\n",
    "mean or extreme value. These operations may be performed on different\n",
    "dimensions of the data, posing a challenge for existing reinforcement\n",
    "learning frameworks. In order to flexibly use data of different formats\n",
    "in reinforcement training, Reverb introduces the concept of *chunk*. All\n",
    "data used for training is stored as chunks in the buffer for management\n",
    "and scheduling. This design takes advantage of data being\n",
    "multidimensional tensors and makes data usage faster and more flexible.\n",
    "DeepMind recently proposed a distributed reinforcement learning\n",
    "framework called Acme , which is also designed for academia research and\n",
