Book Organization and Intended Audience
=======================================

This book adopts a level-by-level approach to discuss design principles
and implementation practices of machine learning systems. The
**Framework Design** part starts with introducing key concepts that
framework users need to understand, including programming interface
design and computational graph. This part then describes the frontend
and backend techniques used in AI compilers as well as key techniques
for processing data, deploying models, and distributing training to
multiple machines. The **Application Scenarios** part elaborates on
several important types of machine learning systems, such as federated
learning and recommender systems, in an attempt to provide readers with
useful knowledge for both deploying and operating machine learning
frameworks in different application scenarios.

This book is intended for the following readers:

1. **Students:** This book provides a wealth of design principles and
   hands-on experience of machine learning systems. Such knowledge will
   help students better understand the theoretical pros and cons and
   practical challenges of machine learning algorithms.

2. **Researchers:** This book aims to help researchers tackle various
   challenges in machine learning implementation and guide them through
   the design of next-generation machine learning algorithms meant to
   solve large-scale practical problems.

3. **Developers:** We also hope this book will allow developers to gain
   a profound understanding on the internal architecture of a machine
   learning system. Such knowledge will move them a step further in
   developing new functions for their applications, debugging system
   performance issues, and even customizing a machine learning system
   based on their business needs.
