1.  Microsoft Team proposes a series of modern AI compilers to enhance
    the utilization of diverse heterogeneous hardware. This paper
    introduces four distinct optimizations: hardware parallel
    utilization, compilation efficiency, memory access improvement for
    enhanced computing efficiency, and efficient control flow execution
    on accelerators. For more details, see *AI Compiler Quartet*[^1]
