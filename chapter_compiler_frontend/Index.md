# AI Compiler Frontend

Tailored for machine learning frameworks, an AI compiler is designed to
convert Python-based machine learning programs into their optimized
forms, enabling efficient native execution on heterogeneous processors.
This chapter first outlines the typical architecture of an AI compiler
before delving into the design of the compiler's frontend. The compiler
frontend incorporates various techniques, including intermediate
representations (IRs), automatic differentiation, type systems, static
analysis, and compilation optimization.

The learning objectives of this chapter include:

-   Understanding the typical architecture of an AI compiler.

-   Understanding the types and implementation of IRs in machine
    learning frameworks.

-   Understanding the methods of automatic differentiation implemented
    in AI compilers.

-   Understanding type systems and static analysis in AI compilers.

-   Understanding common frontend compilation optimization methods used
    by AI compilers.
