Application Scenarios of Machine Learning Systems
=================================================

A machine learning framework is commonly utilized in diverse scenarios,
giving rise to a range of *machine learning systems*. In a broader
context, a machine learning system refers to a collective term
encompassing a variety of software and hardware systems that facilitate
and execute machine learning applications. Figure
:numref:`intro/system-ecosystem` provides an overview of the various
application scenarios for machine learning systems.

   Application scenarios of machine learningsystems


1. **Federated learning:** Laws and regulations on user privacy
   protection and data protection prevent many machine learning
   applications from accessing user data directly for model training
   purposes. This is where federated learning — based on a machine
   learning framework — benefits such applications.

2. **Recommender system:** Incorporating machine learning (especially
   deep learning) into recommender systems have achieved major success
   over the past few years. Compared with traditional rule-based
   recommender systems, those based on deep learning can analyze massive
   feature data of users more effectively, thereby bringing huge
   improvements to the accuracy and timeliness of recommendations.

3. **Reinforcement learning:** Because reinforcement learning is special
   in terms of the way it collects data and trains models, it is
   therefore necessary to develop dedicated reinforcement learning
   systems based on a machine learning framework.

4. **Explainable AI:** As machine learning becomes more and more popular
   in many key areas, including finance, healthcare, and governmental
   affairs, developing explainable AI systems based on a machine
   learning framework is gaining wider attention.

5. **Robotics:** Robotics is another area where the use of machine
   learning frameworks is gaining popularity. Compared with traditional
   robot vision methods, machine learning methods have achieved enormous
   success in several robot tasks, such as automatic feature extraction,
   target recognition, and path planning.

6. **Graph learning:** Graphs are the most widely used data structure
   and are used to express large volumes of Internet data, for instance,
   social network graphs and product relationship graphs. Machine
   learning algorithms have been proven effective for analyzing
   large-scale graph data. A machine learning system designed to process
   graph data is referred to as a graph learning system.

7. **Scientific computing:** Scientific computing covers a wide range of
   traditional fields (such as electromagnetic simulation, graphics, and
   weather forecast), in which many large-scale problems can be
   effectively solved by machine learning methods. Therefore, developing
   special machine learning systems for scientific computing is becoming
   an increasingly common practice.

8. **Scheduling of a machine learning cluster:** A machine learning
   cluster consists of heterogeneous processors, heterogeneous networks,
   and even heterogeneous storage devices. But in a machine learning
   cluster, computing tasks often have common characteristics during
   their execution (e.g., iterative execution based on the collective
   communication operator AllReduce). In order to take account of the
   cluster’s heterogeneity of devices and the common characteristics in
   task execution, a machine learning cluster is often designed to use a
   special scheduling method.

9. **Quantum computing:** Quantum computers are generally realized
   through a hybrid architecture, in which quantum computing is
   performed by quantum computers and the simulation of quantum
   computers is performed by classical computers. Many simulation
   systems (such as TensorFlow Quantum and MindQuantum) are realized on
   the basis of a machine learning framework because the simulation
   often requires massive matrix computations and gradient computation.

There are too many machine learning systems for this book to cover them
all in depth. Instead, we aim to provide a system designer’s perspective
on several core systems used in federated learning, recommenders,
reinforcement learning, explainable AI, and robotics.
