# Conclusions

\(1\) This chapter briefly introduced the background, system
architecture, FedAvg algorithm, privacy encryption algorithms, and
deployment challenges of federated learning. (2) Federated learning is
an AI algorithm that is on the verge of becoming mainstream. It can be
used to establish effective machine learning models under the
constraints of data protection and data silos. (3) In addition, the
distinct characteristics (data on the devices is not uploaded, the
security and privacy requirements are high, and data is non-idd) of
federated learning scenarios increase the difficulties in developing
systems and algorithms. (4) Such difficulties include balancing the
computing overhead and communication overhead, ensuring that models do
not leak privacy, and enabling algorithms to converge in non-idd
scenarios. All these difficulties require developers to have a deeper
understanding of federated learning scenarios.
