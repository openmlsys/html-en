# Performance Optimization Methods

Hardware accelerators boast intricate computational and memory
architectures. To maximize their performance, developers frequently need
to grasp a variety of performance optimization methods. Common methods
encompass enhancing arithmetic intensity, capitalizing effectively on
shared memory, optimizing the memory load/store pipeline, among others.
The subsequent sections will elucidate these methods through practical
programming examples, all aimed towards a singular objective:
accelerating an FP32 GEMM program.
