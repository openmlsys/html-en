# Performance Optimization Methods

Hardware accelerators boast intricate computational and memory
architectures. To maximize their performance, developers frequently need
to grasp a variety of performance optimization methods. Common methods
encompass enhancing arithmetic intensity, capitalizing effectively on
shared memory, optimizing the memory load/store pipeline, among others.
The subsequent sections will elucidate these methods through practical
programming examples, all aimed towards a singular objective:
accelerating an FP32 GEMM program.

## Implementing General Matrix Multiplication

CodeÂ `lst:cpu` shows a reference implementation of GEMM in C++.

**lst:cpu**
```cpp
float A[M][K];
float B[K][N];
float C[M][N];
float alpha, beta;

for (unsigned m = 0; m < M; ++m) {
    for (unsigned n = 0; n < N; ++n) {
        float c = 0;
        for (unsigned k = 0; k < K; ++k) {
            c += A[m][k] * B[k][n];
        }
        C[m][n] = alpha * c + beta * C[m][n];
    }
}
```
