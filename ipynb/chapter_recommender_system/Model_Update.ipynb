    "# Model Update\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-world setting, it is crucial for these systems to routinely\n",
    "update their model parameters. However, maintaining seamless user\n",
    "experience while concurrently updating ultra-large-scale recommendation\n",
    "models becomes a daunting task, especially when catering to a large\n",
    "number of online users. This section primarily addresses why continuous\n",
    "updates to model parameters are necessary for recommender systems,\n",
    "before delving into the offline update methodology and a recommender\n",
    "system capable of online updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Necessity for Model Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation models employed in online services encounter highly\n",
    "dynamic factors in their datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **New users and items**: Both the users targeted by a recommendation\n",
    "    model and the items encompassed within the model are in constant\n",
    "    flux. New users and items can emerge at any given time. As depicted\n",
    "    in Figure :numref:`embedding missing`, the recommender model will be\n",
    "    unable to cater to a new user if the embedding table lacks the\n",
    "    corresponding embedding item. Similarly, if a newly added item is\n",
    "    absent from the model's embedding table, it will not surface in the\n",
    "    recommendation pipeline, rendering it impossible to recommend to the\n",
    "    intended users.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Shifting user interests**: Recommendation models must adapt to\n",
    "    continually shifting user interests. Should a model fail to swiftly\n",
    "    adjust its weights to mirror evolving user interests, the quality of\n",
    "    its recommendations may suffer. As an example, in a news\n",
    "    recommendation application, trending news topics alter daily. If the\n",
    "    model consistently suggests outdated trends, the click-through rate\n",
    "    (CTR) of users will progressively decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure id=\"fig:embedding missing\">\n",
    "<p>Â </p>\n",
    "<figcaption>Examples of Missing Embedding Items</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "While empirical rule formulation (such as directly incorporating new or\n",
    "statistically popular items into the recommendation results) can\n",
    "potentially address the above dynamic factors, it only provides a\n",
    "temporary and partial solution. Such empirical methods cannot entirely\n",
    "rectify the problems, mainly due to the substantial performance gap\n",
    "between learning-based recommendation models and experience-based\n",
    "recommendation rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Offline Process of Model Update\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep up with the evolving dynamics of datasets, recommender systems\n",
    "need to consistently accumulate new training data and harness this\n",
    "information to refine their models. This process, known as model\n",
    "updating, is integral to improving the efficacy of these systems.\n",
    "Typically, the trained model is saved as a checkpoint, which is then put\n",
    "through an offline validation process. This updated model is only\n",
    "deployed onto the inference servers if it can effectively enhance the\n",
    "quality of recommendation. A depiction of this offline model update\n",
    "process can be seen in Figure\n",
    ":numref:`offline update`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Offline Process of UpdatingModels](../img/ch_recommender/offline_update.png)\n",
    ":label:`offline update`\n",
    "\n",
    "To break it down, when a model completes a training period, the\n",
    "subsequent steps unfold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Checkpoint step**: The model checkpoint is retrieved from the\n",
    "    parameter server in the training data center and stored on the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Validation step**: This checkpoint undergoes validation against an\n",
    "    offline dataset. If it does not pass this validation, the model\n",
    "    continues its training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Dissemination step**: If the model checkpoint passes the offline\n",
    "    validation, it is then disseminated to the parameter servers which\n",
    "    host the replicas of this model in different inference data centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Needs for Low-latency Model Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an offline process of updating models described above can vary in\n",
    "duration, ranging from several minutes to hours. Nevertheless, some\n",
    "systems have streamlined the procedures for storing and propagating\n",
    "checkpoints, which allows updates to occur on a minute-by-minute basis.\n",
    "Despite this, the existing minute-level latency in model updates still\n",
    "falls short of the requirements for several key scenarios that involve\n",
    "recommender systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incorporating Fresh Content\n",
    "\n",
    "There are needs in which applications prioritize the delivery of fresh\n",
    "content. For example, in the context of short video recommendations, a\n",
    "content creator might generate videos relevant to the latest trending\n",
    "topics. If these videos are not recommended in a timely manner, the\n",
    "topics may become obsolete, resulting in a lower-than-anticipated number\n",
    "of views.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Servicing Anonymous Users\n",
    "\n",
    "There are often needs where user features are either unavailable or\n",
    "scarce. Users are increasingly opting for anonymous usage of\n",
    "applications and sharing minimal data due to heightened privacy concerns\n",
    "(e.g., Internet browsers prohibit recommender systems from collecting\n",
    "user cookies) and stricter data protection regulations (e.g., the\n",
    "General Data Protection Regulation -- GDPR -- in Europe). As a result,\n",
    "recommender systems are compelled to learn user interests online within\n",
    "a very narrow timeframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adopting Online Machine Learning Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "There are needs that call for the application of online machine learning\n",
    "techniques. Traditional recommender systems often employ offline\n",
    "training where data gathered over a specified timeframe (e.g., one day)\n",
    "is used to train a model, which is subsequently deployed online during\n",
    "off-peak periods (e.g., early morning). However, recent research and\n",
    "practice suggest that increasing the training frequency can notably\n",
    "improve the quality of recommendations. The logical endpoint of\n",
    "increasing training frequency is online training, where data is\n",
    "processed in a streaming fashion and fed to the model. The model then\n",
    "continually fine-tunes its parameters based on these online samples.\n"
