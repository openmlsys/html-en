    "-   A recommender system is underpinned by a complex architecture that\n",
    "    incorporates a multitude of system components such as message\n",
    "    queues, feature stores, neural networks, embedding tables, parameter\n",
    "    servers, training servers, and inference servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A recommendation decision typically proceeds through a pipeline that\n",
    "    includes both the retrieval and ranking stages. The ranking stage\n",
    "    can be further dissected into pre-ranking, ranking, and\n",
    "    post-ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To ensure high-quality recommendations, a recommendation model\n",
    "    requires continual updates. Generally, the more frequent the model\n",
    "    updates, the higher the quality of the recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Modern recommender systems are delving into the possibilities of\n",
    "    real-time machine learning. To make this concept practically\n",
    "    feasible, researchers are exploring how to leverage the unique data\n",
    "    characteristics of recommender systems to address several critical\n",
    "    system challenges. This exploration has led to new system designs\n",
    "    that include application-specific synchronization protocols,\n",
    "    application-aware network update scheduling, and online model state\n",
    "    management.\n"
