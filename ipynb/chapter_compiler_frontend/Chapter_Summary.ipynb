    "# Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Intermediate Representation (IR) serves as one of the fundamental\n",
    "    data structures of a compiler. It represents the transition from the\n",
    "    source language to the target language during the process of program\n",
    "    compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Classical compilers categorize IRs into three types based on their\n",
    "    structure: linear IR, graphical IR, and hybrid IR.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The demands imposed by machine learning frameworks necessitate new\n",
    "    forms of IRs, as classical IRs fail to fully satisfy these\n",
    "    requirements. Therefore, innovative IRs that are more compatible\n",
    "    with these frameworks must be developed based on classical IRs.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The central principle in automatic differentiation is the\n",
    "    decomposition of a program's arithmetic operations into a finite set\n",
    "    of basic operations. Knowing the derivative evaluation rules for all\n",
    "    these operations allows for the calculation of the derivative for\n",
    "    each basic operation. Subsequently, these results are aggregated\n",
    "    using the chain rule to obtain the derivative result for the entire\n",
    "    program.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Automatic differentiation operates in two modes---forward-mode and\n",
    "    reverse-mode---based on the sequence adopted by the chain rule for\n",
    "    combining derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Forward-mode automatic differentiation is applied when evaluating\n",
    "    the derivative of a network where the input dimension is smaller\n",
    "    than the output dimension. In contrast, reverse-mode automatic\n",
    "    differentiation is employed when the output dimension of a network\n",
    "    is smaller than the input dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Implementation methods for automatic differentiation encompass\n",
    "    elemental libraries, operator overloading, and source\n",
    "    transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Type systems, which are utilized to define various types, detail the\n",
    "    operations of each type and outline the interactions among types.\n",
    "    Comprising a set of types and the type-based rules that delineate\n",
    "    program behavior, type systems are extensively used in compilers,\n",
    "    interpreters, and static checking tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Static analysis involves the inspection and verification of code\n",
    "    through lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, control flow analysis,\n",
    "    and data flow analysis, all of which are conducted without executing\n",
    "    the programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The objective of compilation optimization is to boost the efficiency\n",
    "    of the IRs generated during the compilation process. Notably,\n",
    "    compilation optimization conducted at the frontend is\n",
    "    hardware-agnostic.\n"
