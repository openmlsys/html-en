# Part I Framework Design {#part-i-framework-design .unnumbered}

In Part 1, we present a top-down approach to designing a machine
learning framework. We begin by introducing the design of programming
models for machine learning frameworks, followed by a discussion on
representing a machine learning program as a computational graph. The
machine learning program undergoes compilation by an AI compiler, which
employs a range of frontend and backend techniques. Additionally, we
will delve into the system components within a machine learning
framework that facilitate data processing, model deployment, and
distributed training.
