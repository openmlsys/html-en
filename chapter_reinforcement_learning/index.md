# Reinforcement Learning System

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a subfield of machine
learning that focuses on how autonomous agents can learn to make optimal
decisions through interactions with their environments. By designating
rewards or penalties for each action taken, RL provides a framework for
training intelligent systems to maximize cumulative reward over time.
