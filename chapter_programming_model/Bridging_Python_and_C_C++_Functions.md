# Bridging Python and C/C++ Functions

Developers frequently encounter the need to incorporate custom operators
into a machine learning framework. These operators implement new models,
optimizers, data processing functions, and more. Custom operators, in
particular, often require implementation in C/C++ to achieve optimized
performance. They also have Python interfaces, facilitating developers
to integrate custom operators with existing machine learning workflows
written in Python. This section will delve into the implementation
details of this process.

The Python interpreter, being implemented in C, enables the invocation
of C and C++ functions within Python. Contemporary machine learning
frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MindSpore rely on pybind11
to automatically generate Python functions from underlying C and C++
functions. This mechanism is known as *Python binding*. Prior to the
advent of pybind11, Python binding was accomplished using one of the
following approaches:

1.  **C-APIs in Python**: This approach necessitates the inclusion of
    `Python.h` in C++ programs and the utilization of Python's C-APIs to
    execute Python operations. To effectively work with C-APIs,
    developers must possess a comprehensive understanding of Python's
    internal implementation, such as managing reference counting.

2.  **Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG)**: SWIG serves
    as a bridge between C/C++ code and Python, and it played a
    significant role in the initial development of TensorFlow. Utilizing
    SWIG involves crafting intricate interface statements and relying on
    SWIG to automatically generate C code that interfaces with Python's
    C-APIs. However, due to the lack of readability in the generated
    code, the maintenance costs associated with it tend to be high.

3.  **Python `ctypes` module**: This module encompasses a comprehensive
    range of types found in the C language and allows direct invocation
    of dynamic link libraries (DLLs). However, a limitation of this
    module is its heavy reliance on native C types, which results in
    insufficient support for customized types.

4.  **CPython**: In basic terms, CPython can be described as the fusion
    of Python syntax with static types from the C language. It
    facilitates the retention of Python's syntax while automatically
    translating CPython functions into C/C++ code. This functionality
    empowers developers to seamlessly incorporate invocations of C/C++
    functions within the CPython environment.

5.  **Boost::Python (a C++ library)**: Boost::Python allows for the
    exposure of C++ functions as Python functions. It operates on
    similar principles to Python's C-APIs but provides a more
    user-friendly interface. However, the reliance on the Boost library
    introduces a significant dependency on third-party components, which
    can be a potential drawback for Boost::Python.

In comparison to the above Python binding approaches, pybind11 shares
similarities with Boost::Python in terms of simplicity and usability.
However, pybind11 stands out due to its focus on supporting C++ 11 and
eliminating dependencies on Boost. As a lightweight Python library,
pybind11 is particularly suitable for exposing numerous Python functions
in complex C++ projects such as the machine learning system discussed in
this book. The combination of Code
`ch02/code2.5.1` and Code
`ch02/code2.5.2` is an example of adding a custom operator to
Pytorch with the integration of C++ and Python:\
In C++:

**ch02/code2.5.1**
```cpp
//custom_add.cpp
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <pybind11/pybind11.h>

torch::Tensor custom_add(torch::Tensor a, torch::Tensor b) {
    return a + b;
}

PYBIND11_MODULE(TORCH_EXTENSION_NAME, m) {
    m.def("custom_add", &custom_add, "A custom add function");
}
```

In Python:

**ch02/code2.5.2**
```python
import torch
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load

# Load the C++ extension
custom_extension = load(
    name='custom_extension',
    sources=['custom_add.cpp'],
    verbose=True
)
# Use your custom add function
a = torch.randn(10)
b = torch.randn(10)
c = custom_extension.custom_add(a, b)
```
