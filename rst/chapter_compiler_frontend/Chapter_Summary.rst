Chapter Summary
===============

-  Intermediate Representation (IR) serves as one of the fundamental
   data structures of a compiler. It represents the transition from the
   source language to the target language during the process of program
   compilation.

-  Classical compilers categorize IRs into three types based on their
   structure: linear IR, graphical IR, and hybrid IR.

-  The demands imposed by machine learning frameworks necessitate new
   forms of IRs, as classical IRs fail to fully satisfy these
   requirements. Therefore, innovative IRs that are more compatible with
   these frameworks must be developed based on classical IRs.

-  The central principle in automatic differentiation is the
   decomposition of a program’s arithmetic operations into a finite set
   of basic operations. Knowing the derivative evaluation rules for all
   these operations allows for the calculation of the derivative for
   each basic operation. Subsequently, these results are aggregated
   using the chain rule to obtain the derivative result for the entire
   program.

-  Automatic differentiation operates in two modes—forward-mode and
   reverse-mode—based on the sequence adopted by the chain rule for
   combining derivatives.

-  Forward-mode automatic differentiation is applied when evaluating the
   derivative of a network where the input dimension is smaller than the
   output dimension. In contrast, reverse-mode automatic differentiation
   is employed when the output dimension of a network is smaller than
   the input dimension.

-  Implementation methods for automatic differentiation encompass
   elemental libraries, operator overloading, and source transformation.

-  Type systems, which are utilized to define various types, detail the
   operations of each type and outline the interactions among types.
   Comprising a set of types and the type-based rules that delineate
   program behavior, type systems are extensively used in compilers,
   interpreters, and static checking tools.

-  Static analysis involves the inspection and verification of code
   through lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, control flow analysis,
   and data flow analysis, all of which are conducted without executing
   the programs.

-  The objective of compilation optimization is to boost the efficiency
   of the IRs generated during the compilation process. Notably,
   compilation optimization conducted at the frontend is
   hardware-agnostic.
