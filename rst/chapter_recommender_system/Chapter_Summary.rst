Chapter Summary
===============

-  A recommender system is underpinned by a complex architecture that
   incorporates a multitude of system components such as message queues,
   feature stores, neural networks, embedding tables, parameter servers,
   training servers, and inference servers.

-  A recommendation decision typically proceeds through a pipeline that
   includes both the retrieval and ranking stages. The ranking stage can
   be further dissected into pre-ranking, ranking, and post-ranking.

-  To ensure high-quality recommendations, a recommendation model
   requires continual updates. Generally, the more frequent the model
   updates, the higher the quality of the recommendations.

-  Modern recommender systems are delving into the possibilities of
   real-time machine learning. To make this concept practically
   feasible, researchers are exploring how to leverage the unique data
   characteristics of recommender systems to address several critical
   system challenges. This exploration has led to new system designs
   that include application-specific synchronization protocols,
   application-aware network update scheduling, and online model state
   management.
