Chapter Summary
===============

1. In order to achieve a balance between usability and performance,
   modern machine learning systems utilize Python for frontend
   programming and C/C++ for backend programming.

2. It is expected from a machine learning framework to offer programming
   support for all aspects of a machine learning application workflow.
   This is usually delivered through high-level Python APIs, which
   facilitate activities such as data processing, model definition, loss
   function determination, model training, and model testing.

3. Large DNNs can be constructed by stacking neural network layers.

4. Various technologies are used to facilitate interoperability between
   Python and C, with pybind being a popular choice in machine learning
   frameworks.

5. Machine learning frameworks typically offer a variety of C/C++
   interfaces, allowing users to define and register operators
   implemented in C++. These operators enable users to create various
   framework extensions, such as high-performance models, data
   processing functions, and optimizers.
