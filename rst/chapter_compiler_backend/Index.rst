AI Compiler Backend
===================

In this chapter, we will explore the design of the AI compiler backend.
The objective of an AI compiler backend is to enhance the efficiency of
AI program execution by optimizing the Intermediate Representation (IR)
generated by the compiler frontend. This optimization enables the full
utilization of hardware capabilities. The backend achieves this goal by
applying optimizations to IR code based on hardware capabilities.
Furthermore, it selects suitable operators based on the capabilities of
target hardware to execute computations efficiently, while also
allocating memory to optimize data reuse and locality. Additionally, the
backend often incorporates an operator compiler, which optimizes the
execution strategy for code statements associated with operators.

This chapter aims to achieve the following learning objectives:

-  Understand the role and architecture of an AI compiler backend.

-  Understand typical methods for optimizing computational graphs.

-  Understand typical methods for selecting operators.

-  Understand typical methods for memory allocation.

-  Understand the architecture and functionalities of operator
   compilers.
