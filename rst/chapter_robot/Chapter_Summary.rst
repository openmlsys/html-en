Chapter Summary
===============

This chapter briefly introduced the basic concepts of robotic systems â€”
including the general Robot Operating System (ROS), perception system,
planning system, and control system. In sections about ROS, we reviewed
the basic concepts and demonstrated code examples to familiarize you
with the process of building ROS. Currently, robotics is a fast-growing
branch of artificial intelligence. Many practical problems require
further advancement in algorithms and system designs of robotics before
they can be solved.
